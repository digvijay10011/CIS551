We can determine how much money is in an account because the bank will send the
same response when a command is valid and a different response when a command is
invalid, every time.
First we send a valid atm command to determine what the good message is
and then we send an invalid atm command to determine what the bad message is.
Then we attempt to withdraw a certain amount of money, and we check if the
withdrawl succeeded or failed. We start with the maximum amount of money, and
we reduce our withdrawl amounts by half each iteration, until we get to $0.01.
We sum up all of the successful withdrawls, and when we can't withdraw another
cent, we know we have the secret amount.
