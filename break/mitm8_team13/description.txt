The bank does not print protocol error and the atm does not exit with the correct  error if the man 
in the middle inserts random garbage into the conversation so neither end knows if something fishy is 
going on. This makes it easier for the attacker to try a variety of approaches when attacking,
including by corrupting certain transactions.
