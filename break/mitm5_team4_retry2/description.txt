The randomness for generating the authfile is insufficient. It is just seeded with the 
current time and it is relatively for an attacker to get close to this value, in this case
the mitm is running on the same system so it is relatively easy to get a good estimate
of what this seed was, then it can simply take the first message it sees and brute force
the key by trying times around the time it thinks the original key was created until
it gets a match. At this point the attacker can do whatever she pleases.
