Atm seems to never exit with code 63 even when there is protocol error.
The entire socket thing in Atm.java is wrapped with with try/catch which exists with 255 when some exception is thrown, no matter if the exception was thrown due to protocol error.
In our test case, wrong IP address should ideally result in exiting with 63 but it exits with code 255.
