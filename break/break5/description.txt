They didn't handle the rollback thing properly.

At line number around 367 in atm.cpp, when they get message that the transaction failed, they are just exiting and not deleting the card file already created.

So suppose there is an account with bob and card file bob.card
When new account is tried to create with name bob but cardfile alice.card, it will fail and alice.card should be deleted but they are handling this rollback.
