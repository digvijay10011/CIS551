The implementation is vulnerable to replay attacks since it just
uses a regular symmetric encryption cipher.
Although there is an attempt to remedy this by using a random
value for each message, it appears that in the newRandom function
the number is checked for membership in the list as a string and then 
if new added to the list as a number so the check of membership always fails.
