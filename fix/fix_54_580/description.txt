We are using Integer.valueOf() method to parse port numbers.
Both the breaks were passing some value such that it cannot be parsed by this method.(break 580 has an extra space and break 54 is a flaot and not integer)
Hence above method was throwing NumberFormatException and we didn't handle that exception.
We wrapped that call with try/catch block and hence the issue got solved.
