The bug was that, if an option value had a hyphen as the first character,
it was treated as an option rather than as a value.
This resulted in the atm rejecting valid input commands,
such as `./atm -a -c -c -c -n 100.00` or `./atm -a -c -gc -c`, where "-c" is the
account name and also the name of the card file.
To fix it, we manually check if a hyphened value exists, and then remove the
hyphen temporarily for the parsing, and then add the hyphen back in.
Note that the same team often submitted two bug reports on this, but we don't
know if that counts as 2 different bugs.
