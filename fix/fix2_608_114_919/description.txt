All these breaks were targeting the case when one of the fields of ip was 00.
Our validateNumber() method in Validator.java was implemented in such a way that it was first checking if the number has value equal to zero. If yes, it was returning true.
After that, it was checking for the leading zero.
So any number such as 098, 012312, etc. would not pass but if its 00 then it will pass.
We just added a check for that and all these three bags were solved.
